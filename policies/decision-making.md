# Decision-making

We prioritize consensus-building for all decision-making.
When this isn't possible, majority vote is a last resort.

This policy is a work in progress, more updates to come.

For inspiration, see the
[Project Jupyter decision-making guide](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision-making/).
